# Tokenomics
Otomic’s tokenomics are quite simple and essentially revolve around users paying to use bots with Otomic tokens. Thus, Otomic tokens have a clear utility.


# Detailed Explanation
1. There is a fixed total supply of coins. It is allocated to investors, the Otomic team, and the community.

2. All the bots on the Otomic network will take Otomic coins as payment.

    For example:

- A telegram trading bot will require coin payments to execute trading strategies for you.

- A bridge LP node is a bot on the network. The transaction fee collected by the network (paid by the retail user on the other side of the trade) is in coins.

3. Otomic coin payments are distributed as follows.

- 80% goes to the bot operator to compensate for the cost of running the bot.

- 20% goes to the developer of the bot’s software.

4. The foundation will develop the first bots and become the initial bot operators. Over time, there will be more people on the network earning coins (other operators and bot developers).

5. Users will purchase Otomic coins from the open market in order to use the network.

- The foundation or the investors could be an initial seller of those coins.

# What is Otomic?

Otomic is a network of trading bots. These bots interact with each other by automatically quoting and bidding on prices. Users pay coins to use bots to trade on their behalf. 

To supply users with high-quality bots from which to choose, Otomic hosts a decentralized bot marketplace. Developers have an incentive to create the highest performing bots with advantages curated to users’ preferences, and high performing bots will be labeled as such in the marketplace. Users can then choose to use the bot(s) that best align with their use cases and trading strategy.

## Why Otomic?

Manually trading assets is inefficient and relies on error-prone human judgment. Thus, trading bots enable users to implement automated trading strategies that save time and improve outcomes.

Moreover, Otomic’s easy-to-understand tokenomics provides transparency for how value is transferred in the Otomic ecosystem. For example, Otomic coins offer clear utility – they enable users to employ bots to manage and optimize trading activity.

## How Does Otomic Work?

Users pay to use bots to facilitate various use cases, such as trading on DEXs or performing cross-chain transactions.

Anyone can develop Otomic bots, and the best-performing bots will become most popular on Otomic’s bot marketplace.

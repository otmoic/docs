# Use Cases
Otomic supports many bot use cases (several of which are explained below) and bot interfaces (Telegram, within Otomic's product, etc.).

## DEX Trading bots
DEX trading bots facilitate decentralized exchanges on behalf of a user, automating the trading process, trading around the clock, improving trade accuracy and market timing, and eliminating downside associated with human emotion.

Bots in Otomic’s network can be highly diverse, varying based on 

1. individual traders’ strategies and
2. competition between developers to build the best bots.

Some bots may, for example, specialize at sniping new tokens or copy-trading. Currently unforeseen bot functions are likely to evolve as developers explore new domains.

## Liquidity Provider (LP) Agent
LP Agents are an important part of Otomic’s unique edge client architecture.

An LP Node Agent bot provides on-demand liquidity for cross-chain value exchanges. Operating on behalf of what is typically an institutional liquidity provider, LP Agents only deploy liquidity when it is needed rather than relying on vulnerable liquidity pools.

LP Agents are instructed by LP’s to pursue a certain strategy, and agents enable LP nodes to compete on exchange rates for each user request. This decentralized pricing approach does not rely on oracles or price feeds.

LP agent bots also facilitate operations that would be technically challenging for users such as atomic swaps.

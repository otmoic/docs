# Obridge: RFQ Network for Web3

Obridge is a decentralized and automated request for quote (RFQ) network that supports secure cross-chain value exchanges. 

As a permission-less, automated trading network based on atomic swap contracts, Obridge can facilitate exchanges between any pair of L1 or L2 blockchains *without* using asset pools. Compared to other bridge solutions, especially those based on a liquidity pool or lock-and-mint mechanism, Obridge is:

* Much safer
* Faster (especially for withdrawals)
* Cheaper
* More censorship resistant
* More capital efficient
* Polyglot (i.e., supports non-EVM native assets)
* Easier to use

Next, let's learn how Obridge works as a DEX and a bridge.

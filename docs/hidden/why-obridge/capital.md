# Capital Efficiency

Compared with pool-based Bridge, the most apparent advantage of Obrige is that it dramatically improves capital efficiency.

Pool-based bridges lock up tokens and prevent the tokens from being used in other applications. That means the bridge projects must incentivize liquidity providers through yield farming. Oftentimes, the bridge project uses its own DAO token as liquidity incentives, essentially giving away future equity of the project and hampering the long-term viability of those projects.

> The liquidity pool must be at least 10x larger than the largest transaction it aims to support in order to avoid excessive slippage. You would need a pool of $100m in order to support a $10m transaction. That means 90% of the fund in the pool is idle and not productive most of the time.

However, based on the HTLC atomic swap, Obirdge doesn't need a long-lived asset pool. That means LP's assets won't be locked into a pool. LP's asset is free to use when no exchange transactions happen.

Instead of a long-lived pool, the atomic swap design only requires the LP to come up with the tokens at the time of the exchange.

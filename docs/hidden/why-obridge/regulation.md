# Regulation compliant

The Atomic Swap is a peer-to-peer exchange. 

There is no single liquidity pool that acts as a counter party to all users. 

Without KYCed LPs, the pool itself could be a non-compliant exchange counterparty. While it is technically possible to KYC LPs in a pool, it is not commonly done and very hard to remove LPs when a problem emerges later.


A single LP node can act as a counter party on Bridge. It's easy to KYC a LP node and remove a non-compliant LP node for Obridge operator. On the other hand, users can choose to ask Obridge to only broadcast to compliant LP nodes.

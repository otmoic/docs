# Censorship resistant

Obridge is cesorship resistant by no single liquidity and allowing anonymous LP nodes in this network.


Pool-based bridges are vulnerable to censorship. Large liquidity pools or lock-and-mint pools are centralized constructs that are managed by a few key holders. The pool operators can censor who has access to the pool. The censorship problem is further exacerbated by the pool's need for regulation compliance. See the Regulation Compliant section for more details.


With the decentralized Obridge, each liquidity provider can decide whom to do business with (ie to exchange) based on individual preference and local regulations. For an individual user, there is a high likelihood to always find someone to exchange within a diverse group of liquidity providers. Or, the user could choose to exchange with an anonymous LP node.
